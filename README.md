## 📝 File Naming Convention

- **Standard format:** `Problem_Name.cpp` (e.g., `Two_Sum_II.cpp`)
- **Multiple approaches:** `Problem_Name_Approach2.cpp`
- **Contest problems:** `Problem_A.cpp`, `Problem_B.cpp`, etc.

## 💻 Solution Standards

Each solution captures not just the code, but the thought process behind it. Every file includes a detailed comment block:
```cpp
/*
Problem: [Problem Name]
Platform: [LeetCode/Codeforces/etc.]
Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard] or [Rating]
Link: [Problem URL]

Logic:
- Brief explanation of the approach
- Key observations and insights
- Algorithm/Data structure used

Complexity:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

Approach: [Brute Force/Optimal/Alternative]
*/
```

**Tech Stack:**
- **Language:** C++17
- **Compiler:** g++
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code

## 🛠️ How to Run Solutions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install g++ compiler (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get install g++

# Verify installation
g++ --version
```

### Compile and Execute
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vivekwaldia/My-DSA-Journey.git
cd My-DSA-Journey

# Navigate to any solution
cd LeetCode/Problems/Medium

# Compile with C++17
g++ -std=c++17 -o solution Two_Sum_II.cpp

# Run
./solution
```

Most solutions include test cases in comments or within the code. Modify the `main()` function to test with your own inputs.
