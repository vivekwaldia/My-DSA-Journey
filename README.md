# My DSA Journey

> **"Consistency is the code to success."**

**Current Status:** 2nd Semester CSE Student | Focused on Discipline and Logic Building.

This repository documents my problem-solving journey across competitive programming platforms. I add new problems as I solve them and systematically revise previously solved problems to strengthen my understanding.

**LeetCode Progress:** 177+ problems solved | Adding them chronologically for revision.

### 📂 Repository Structure

Solutions are organized first by **Platform** and then by **Topic**. This hierarchy ensures that progress across different coding sites remains easy to navigate and revise.

**Active Platforms:** Codeforces, CodeChef, LeetCode, AtCoder  
**Occasional Practice:** CSES, GeeksForGeeks

### 🛠️ Standards

All solutions are written in **C++** and include a comment block detailing:

1. Logic: Brief explanation of the approach.
2. Complexity: Time (Big O) and Space analysis.
